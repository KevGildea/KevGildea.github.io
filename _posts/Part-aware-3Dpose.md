#### Towards Part-aware Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation: An Architecture Search Approach

Even though most existing monocular 3D pose estimation
approaches achieve very competitive results, they ignore the heterogeneity among human body parts by estimating them with the same network
architecture. To accurately estimate 3D poses of different body parts, we
attempt to build a part-aware 3D pose estimator by searching a set of
network architectures. Consequently, our model automatically learns to
select a suitable architecture to estimate each body part. Compared to
models built on the commonly used ResNet-50 backbone, it reduces 62%
parameters and achieves better performance. With roughly the same
computational complexity as previous models, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on both the single-person and multi-person 3D
pose estimation benchmarks.
