- Introduction
Firstly for some context, let me tell you a little about the background of vehicle safety systems; classified as being 'active', 'passive', or a combination of the two. Active safety systems are onboard electronic devices that are continuously 'active' and working to avoid collision occurence, e.g., traction control, automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection. Whereas, passive safety systems are design features or devices that are generally inactive, only taking effect upon collision occurence to reduce injury outcomes, e.g. helmets, seat belts, air bags, vehicle/infrastructural design (softer/energy dissapating impact surfaces). Integrated safety systems...

  - describe the approach simply with a series of images

  - explain why this is important (previous approaches)

- Methods
  - overall DL pipeline
  - joint optimization approach and considerations
  - overcoming problems associated with MPJPE

- Results
  - describe the resulting dataset

- Discussion
  - importance of this study in the field of accident reconstruction

  - relevance to integrated safety systems
  Though it is not an automatic system and requires some manual annotation, this technique may be a valuable first step towards an integrated pedestrian safety system involving tailored bonnet deployment systems.
