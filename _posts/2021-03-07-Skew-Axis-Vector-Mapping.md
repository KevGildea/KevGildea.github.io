### Background
This post requires some background knowledge of theoretical undepinnings of the 3D rotation group, or the special orthogonal group in three dimensions (i.e. SO(3)). This is an area of Linear Algebra in which special orthogonal matrices are used in 3 three-dimensional Euclidean space {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}\mathbb{R} ^{3}. It's the collection of rotations of three-dimensional space that preserve one distinguished point called the origin. It might be easiest to imagine as all the ways you can rotate a ball—be it a basketball or the Earth itself—that leave the center of the ball fixed. 


Euler's rotation theorem states that, in three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the fixed point.
