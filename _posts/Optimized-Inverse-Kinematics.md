### Background
In a [previous post](https://kevgildea.github.io/blog/Euler-Axis-Vector-Mapping/), I have described 


### Analytical solution

- Need for an approach for mapping dissimilar open kinematic chains (one without joint orientations)
- describe inverse kinematics
- vector mapping
- describe that it involves a nonlinear solution
- describe optimization


### Optimized solution


### Implications
