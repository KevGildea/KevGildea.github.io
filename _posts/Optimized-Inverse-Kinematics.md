### Background
- Need for an approach for mapping dissimilar open kinematic chains (one without joint orientations)
- describe inverse kinematics
- vector mapping
- describe that it involves a nonlinear solution
- describe optimization

### Analytical solution


### Optimized solution


### Implications
