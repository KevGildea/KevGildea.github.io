### Background
In a [previous post](https://kevgildea.github.io/blog/Euler-Axis-Vector-Mapping/), I described how in SO(3) an infinite number of rotation matrices, or axis-angle combinations can be applied to map one vector (a) onto another vector (b). However, all of these rotations must be about Euler axes on the plane that bisects the vectors.

### Analytical solution

- Need for an approach for mapping dissimilar open kinematic chains (one without joint orientations)
- describe inverse kinematics
- vector mapping
- describe that it involves a nonlinear solution
- describe optimization


### Optimized solution


### Implications
