We can use kinematic differential equations to determine both 1) where an object will be and 2) what orientation it will have after a specified amount of time. In this post I describe an example that can be considered representative of a self propelling sphere in a vacuum with no gravitational effect (i.e. dynamics are not considered), initialised with angular and linear velocity.
