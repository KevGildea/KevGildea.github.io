- Crash course in multibody kinematics and dynamics
  - describe the equations of motion, IK, FK, ID, FD, and virtual power

- How can the equations of motion help 3D human pose estimators?
  - describe DNN architectures generally and gradient descent
  - explain how physical knowledge can be built in
  - give context in terms of existing mocap systems (Vicon) which use kinematics to refine estimates
  - how SOTA 3D pose estimators are begining to incorporate more physical knowledge

- Insights on future directions for deep learning cum physics-based approaches to 3D human pose estimation
