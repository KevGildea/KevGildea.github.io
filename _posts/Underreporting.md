It is well documented that cycling collisions are underreported in Police data both internationally (Department for Transport, 2017; International Transport Forum, 2013; Madsen et al., 2018; Rizzi et al., 2013; Shinar et al., 2018; Watson et al., 2015) and in Ireland (Bedford et al., 2011; Foley et al., 2016; Short and Caulfield, 2014). Using probabilistically matched Police and hospital data, Short and Caulfield (2014) estimated that there are roughly 6 times as many cyclist injuries than recorded in Police statistics (reporting rate of roughly 17%)

It is known that collisions where a motorised vehicle is not involved as a collision partner i.e. single cyclist, cyclist-pedestrian or cyclist-cyclist collisions have lower odds of being reported to the Police (International Transport Forum, 2013; Rizzi et al., 2013; Shinar et al., 2018). The biased nature of cyclist collision reporting has clear implications for policy makers and road safety researchers, who generally rely on Police data to determine road safety priorities.

Less severe cyclist collisions have lower odds of being reported to the Police (de Geus et al., 2012; International Transport Forum, 2013; Salifu and Ackaah, 2012; Shinar et al., 2018). Since injurious collisions are much more frequent than fatal ones, their underrepresentation is a significant shortcoming in the assessment of the national burden of cycling injuries. The effects of less severe collisions are also non-trivial, for example, Hours et al. (2013) found that close to half of those who experience a minor injury in a road traffic collision (MAIS1 or MAIS2) still experience regular pain after a year. 

Due to their non-inclusion in police or hospital statistics, non-injurious collisions are not commonly investigated, however, recent studies have demonstrated how near misses have negative effects on perceived safety and cycling participation (Aldred and Crosweller, 2015; Sanders, 2015), which in turn may have adverse effects on cyclist safety via the ‘safety in numbers’ effect (Elvik and Bjørnskau, 2017). Though a recent study into the causality of the effect has indicated that….
