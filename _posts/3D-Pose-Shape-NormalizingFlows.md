#### Weakly Supervised 3D Human Pose and Shape Reconstruction with Normalizing Flows

Monocular 3D human pose and shape estimation is challenging due to the many degrees of freedom of the human body and the
difficulty to acquire training data for large-scale supervised learning in
complex visual scenes. In this paper we present practical semi-supervised
and self-supervised models that support training and good generalization
in real-world images and video. Our formulation is based on kinematic
latent normalizing flow representations and dynamics, as well as differentiable, semantic body part alignment loss functions that support selfsupervised learning. In extensive experiments using 3D motion capture
datasets like CMU, Human3.6M, 3DPW, or AMASS, as well as image
repositories like COCO, we show that the proposed methods outperform
the state of the art, supporting the practical construction of an accurate
family of models based on large-scale training with diverse and incompletely labeled image and video data.
