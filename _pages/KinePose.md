title: "KinePose: Temporally optimized inverse kinematics for 6DOF human pose estimation"
---

The recent emergence of deep learning and computer vision-based 3D human pose estimation presents opportunities for a form of markerless motion-capture.
Current state-of-art approaches have achieved remarkable accuracy in predicting global joint positions, however, many potential practical applications also require information on joint orientations, e.g., in the fields of biomechanics and animation. Furthermore, methods that do include joint orientations will have issues if they are intended for use in applications with predefined kinematic chains with incongruous limb lengths. Therefore, we propose a temporal inverse kinematics (IK) optimization technique to infer joint orientations in a kinematic chain, with a position-based 3D pose estimate as input. This technique may be particularly useful for sports biomechanics, and telehealth applications.
