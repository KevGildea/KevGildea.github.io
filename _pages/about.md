I am a biomechanical engineer with a BAI and MAI from Trinity College Dublin. I am the recipient of the 2017 RSA-Helena Winters Scholarship for Doctoral Studies in Road Safety. My research interests include accidentology, traumatic injury biomechanics, and deep learning based approaches to 3D pose and shape estimation.

## About my current project
The overall aim of the project is to gain a better understanding of minor, serious and fatal cyclist collisions in Ireland, and find ways to effectively increase cyclist safety. Novel and detailed data sources for cyclist collisions are analysed to provide a comprehensive view of the vulnerabilities of cyclists as a group.

Investigation of these data is focused on determining injury prevention strategies using statistical and engineering analysis. I am investigating combined multibody physics and deep learning approaches to traumatic injury biomechanics. Rapid developments in deep learning based pose and shape estimation presents the opportunity to investigate in-the-wild impact kinematics and dynamics. 

Parametric computational modelling is applied to representative collision scenarios using multibody dynamics, and finite element analysis, with the aim of determining injury reduction strategies. This research has the potential to significantly strengthen our understanding of the nature and scale of cycling collisions, and will assist road safety stakeholders to develop evidence based interventions to reduce their occurrence and severity.
