I am a biomechanical engineer with a BAI and MAI from Trinity College Dublin. I am the recipient of the 2017 RSA-Helena Winters Scholarship for Doctoral Studies in Road Safety. My research interests include accidentology, traumatic injury biomechanics, and deep learning based approaches to 3D pose and shape estimation.
