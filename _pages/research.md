The overall aim of the project is to gain a better understanding of minor, serious and fatal cyclist collisions in Ireland, and find ways to effectively increase cyclist safety. Details of cyclist collisions in Ireland are first established through a national survey, and an in-depth analysis of Police investigation files.

I am investigating combined multibody physics and deep learning approaches to traumatic injury biomechanics. Rapid developments in deep learning based pose and shape estimation presents the opportunity to investigate in-the-wild impact kinematics and dynamics.

Parametric computational modelling is applied to representative collision scenarios using multibody dynamics, and finite element analysis, with the aim of determining injury reduction strategies.

This research has the potential to significantly strengthen our understanding of the nature and scale of cycling collisions, and will assist road safety stakeholders to develop evidence based interventions to reduce their occurrence and severity.
