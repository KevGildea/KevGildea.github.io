The overall aim of the project is to gain a better understanding of minor, serious and fatal cyclist collisions in Ireland, and find ways to effectively increase cyclist safety. This project has the potential to significantly strengthen our understanding of the nature and scale of cycling collisions, and may assist road safety stakeholders to develop evidence based interventions to reduce their occurrence and severity.


#### Accidentology
Details of cyclist collisions in Ireland are first established through:
1. A national survey (see questionnaire [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oQ79eB7oZMDdYXNTjVXqaNFdxYstXhBN/view?usp=sharing)).
2. An in-depth analysis of Police investigation files. 

The analysis of these data is focused on finding the most common and injurious cyclist collision configurations and kinematic forms:

#### Deep learning approaches to injury biomechanics
Rapid developments in deep learning based pose and shape estimation presents the opportunity to investigate in-the-wild impact kinematics and dynamics;

e.g. 2D pose estimation, e.g. [Openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose):

e.g. 3D pose and shape estimation, e.g. [VIBE](https://github.com/mkocabas/VIBE):

Parametric computational modelling may then be applied to representative collision scenarios using multibody dynamics, and finite element analysis, to determine injury reduction strategies:
