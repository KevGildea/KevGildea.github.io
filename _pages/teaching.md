I have been the TA for a 4th year mechanical engineering module for the past 4 years (<a href="https://www.tcd.ie/Engineering/assets/module-descriptors/ss/MEU44B17.pdf" target="_blank">MEU44B17</a>). The subject matter relates to the the kinematics and dynamics of multibody systems (systems of rigid bodies connected by kinematic joints). It reviews fundamental linear algebra methods, and introduces students to the 3D rotation group or the special orthogonal group in three dimensions (SO(3)) for three-dimensional kinematics and dynamics operations. The module aims to equip students with theoretical and practical knowledge for computational modelling of multibody systems. Applications include human body modeling for gait and impact analysis, and robotics.

**LO1.** Use vector and tensor algebra to describe three dimensional kinematics/dynamics.

**LO2.** Apply the principles of Newtonian mechanics to the analysis of physical systems in which components can be modelled as essentially rigid.

**LO3.** Analyze the motion of linked rigid body systems in 3-D including the formulation of constraints due to kinematic joints.

**LO4.** Model contact interactions between rigid bodies using software such as MADYMO.

**LO5.** Implement simulation of rigid body systems using the Principle of Virtual Power in computer code such as generalised software (Matlab) and in dedicated software (MADYMO)

**LO6.** Apply the above theory and computational methods to the analysis of e.g. vehicle systems, human gait and impact analysis and robotics.
