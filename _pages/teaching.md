**Multibody dynamics**

I have been the TA for a 4th year mechanical engineering module for the past 4 years (<a href="https://www.tcd.ie/Engineering/assets/module-descriptors/ss/MEU44B17.pdf" target="_blank">MEU44B17</a>). This module on the Dynamics of Multibody systems addresses kinematics and dynamics and is focused on applications in biomechanics. It reviews the fundamental matrix algebra required for kinematics and dynamics analysis and computations, introduces three-dimensional kinematics and dynamics, and covers the theory and procedures for modelling systems of rigid bodies connected by kinematic joints. Applications to human body modeling for gait and impact analysis, vehicle dynamics and robotics are considered.

**LO1.** Use vector and tensor algebra to describe three dimensional kinematics/dynamics.

**LO2.** Apply the principles of Newtonian mechanics to the analysis of physical systems in which components can be modelled as essentially rigid.

**LO3.** Analyze the motion of linked rigid body systems in 3-D including the formulation of constraints due to kinematic joints.

**LO4.** Model contact interactions between rigid bodies using software such as MADYMO.

**LO5.** Implement simulation of rigid body systems using the Principle of Virtual Power in computer code such as generalised software (Matlab) and in dedicated software (MADYMO)

**LO6.** Apply the above theory and computational methods to the analysis of e.g. vehicle systems, human gait and impact analysis and robotics.
